= How the time is counted on the Commodore PET

Commodore BASIC and Operating system has two pseudo-variables, TI and TI$ that
count time. TI is the number of Jiffies (1/60th of a second) since the last boot,
TI$ the time of day (i.e. wraps at 24h).

As discussed in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkabHdR15xs TI on the C64 counts
1/60 seconds (using a CIA timer interrupt). For 50Hz (PAL) C64 machines there is
a correction to account for 50 interrupts per seconds compared to 60 interrupts
per second on the NTSC C64. To determine the timer value, the C64 kernel counts
the number of rasterlines per screen, from this determines the PAL/NTSC variant,
and configures the timer appropriately.

The PET (with CRTC) is even more flexible, as the CRTC timing can be set flexibly.
And, other than the C64, in the PET, the vertical sync signal of the CRTC output
is used to interrupt the CPU (which btw makes the PET ignorant of any CPU speed
changes - interrupts are always at the same speed. A very handy feature if your
CPU suddenly runs at 12 MHz :-)


== Jiffy counting Part 1a - 50Hz

In the BASIC4 kernel we see that the CPU interrupt vector jumps to E455 and from there to 
EA31:

 E452	iE452	JMP ($0090)	; Vector: Hardware Interrupt [3: E62E, 4: E455]
 E455	iE455	JMP $E431

In EA31, as a first thing, the Jiffy counter is incremented, by calling FFEA, and then
a 50/60 Hz correction is done. I.e. every 5 interrupts, the Jiffy is increased another
extra time. This corrects the 50 Hz interrupt to count 60 Jiffies per second.

 E431	iE431	JSR $FFEA	; jmp $f768	udtim	Update System Jiffy Clock
 E434		INC $F8		; 4.80: Counter to speed TI by 6/5
 E436		LDA $F8		; 4.80: Counter to speed TI by 6/5
 E438		CMP #$06
 E43A		BNE $E458
 E43C		LDA #$00
 E43E		STA $F8		; 4.80: Counter to speed TI by 6/5
 E440		BEQ $E431

This indicates that the ROM disassembly here is taken from a European PET, that has 
the CRTC programmed to 50Hz.

This can be confirmed by looking at the CRTC configuration table from that same 
Editor ROM (Exxx is Editor ROM, so the routine above is in the same chip):

; -	Video Chip Setup Table -- e07a		DATA

 E72A		.byte 31 28 29 0F 27 00 19 20  ;1().'.. 
 E732		.byte 00 09 00 00 10 00 00 00  ;........
 E73A		.byte 00 00                    ;..


; -	Video Chip Setup Table -- e08a		DATA

 E73C		.byte 31 28 29 0F 31 00 19 25  ;1().1..%
 E744		.byte 00 07 00 00 10 00 00 00  ;........
 E74C		.byte 00                       ;.

Using the register file information from http://www.6502.org/users/andre/hwinfo/crtc/diffs.html
we see that we have:

 Horizontal total chars:	R0+1		$32/50		$32/50
 Vertical total char rows:	R4+1		$28/40		$32/50
 Rasterlines per character:	R9+1		10		8
 Adjust rasterlines:		R5		0		0
 Total cycles per screen			50*(40*10)	50*(50*8)
						20000		20000


Indeed there are 20000 cycles per screen - which is 50Hz at a clock speed of 1 MHz.


== Jiffy counting Part 1b - 60Hz

When we look at a 60Hz Editor ROM, e.g. here http://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/firmware/computers/pet/edit-4-40-n-60hz-901499-01.dis.txt
we see that the 6/5 fix is in there as well!

 E42E: 20 EA FF  JSR $FFEA	; Advance Clock
 E431: EE ED 03  INC TIADJ	; Counter to speed TI by 6/5 (40col)
 E434: AD ED 03  LDA TIADJ	; Counter to speed TI by 6/5 (40col)
 E437: C9 06     CMP #$06	; 6 IRQ's?
 E439: D0 1D     BNE L_E458	; No, do normal IRQ
 E43B: A9 00     LDA #$00	; Reset IRQ adjustment counter
 E43D: 8D ED 03  STA TIADJ  	; Counter to speed TI by 6/5 (40col)
 E440: F0 EC     BEQ L_E42E	; Do normal IRQ

But it is not called!

 E452: 6C 90 00  JMP ($0090) 	; Vector: Hardware Interrupt -> $E455
 E455: 20 EA FF  JSR $FFEA

Instead of a JMP to the correction routine, the Jiffy increment is called directly!

Also, the CRTC is programmed differently:

 ;--------------- CRTC SETUP TABLES
 ; This table is used to setup the CRTC chip screen parameters.
 ; The values here configure the screen for 20kHz

 E7B1:           .BYT 31,28,29,0F,20,03,19,1D	; CRTC register data -  40 COL TEXT mode
 E7B9:           .BYT 00,09,00,00,10,00,00,00	; CRTC register data -  40 COL TEXT mode
 E7C1:           .BYT 00,00			; CRTC register data -  40 COL TEXT mode

 E7C3:           .BYT 31,28,29,0F,28,05,19,21	; CRTC register data -  40 COL GRAPHICS mode
 E7CB:           .BYT 00,07,00,00,10,00,00,00	; CRTC register data -  40 COL GRAPHICS mode
 E7D3:           .BYT 00,00 			; CRTC register data -  40 COL GRAPHICS mode

 Horizontal total chars:	R0+1		$32/50		$32/50
 Vertical total char rows:	R4+1		$21/33		$29/41
 Rasterlines per character:	R9+1		10		8
 Adjust rasterlines:		R5		3		5
 Total cycles per screen			50*(33*10+3)	50*(41*8+5)
						16650		16650

The number of cycles per screen is 16650 in both (upper/lower and upper/graphics) mode.
I.e. the screen refresh is not exactly 60Hz, which would be 16667 cycles. 
This is only about 1/1000th off the actual frequency.

== Jiffy counting part 2

We ignored going deeper into the ROM routine at $FFEA, where the Jiffies are actually counted.
That is where we look at now:

 FFEA	iFFEA	JMP $F768	; Update Jiffy Clock

And then

 ; Update Jiffy Clock

 F768	iF768	INC $99		; Jiffy clock correction: 623rd 1/60 sec does not increment time
 F76A		LDA $99		; Jiffy clock correction: 623rd 1/60 sec does not increment time
 F76C		BNE $F770
 F76E		INC $9A
 F770	iF770	CMP #$6F
 F772		BNE $F77A
 F774		LDA $9A
 F776		CMP #$02
 F778		BEQ $F79B

 F77A	iF77A	INC $8F
 F77C		BNE $F784
 F77E		INC $8E
 F780		BNE $F784
 F782		INC $8D		; Real-Time Jiffy Clock (approx) 1/60 Sec
 F784	iF784	LDX #$00
 F786	iF786	LDA $8D,X	; Real-Time Jiffy Clock (approx) 1/60 Sec
 F788		CMP $F7AC,X	; ?						DATA
 F78B		BCC $F7A1
 F78D		INX
 F78E		CPX #$03
 F790		BNE $F786
 F792		LDA #$00
 F794	iF794	STA $8C,X
 F796		DEX
 F797		BNE $F794
 F799		BEQ $F7A1

 F79B	iF79B	LDA #$00
 F79D		STA $99		; Jiffy clock correction: 623rd 1/60 sec does not increment time
 F79F		STA $9A

 ...

 F7AC	sF7AC	.byte 4F 1A 01                 ;o..

Now, this code is strange. 
The memory map gives these explanations:

 TIME	008D-008F	141-143	Real-Time Jiffy Clock (approx) 1/60 Sec
 ...
        0099-009A       152-154 Jiffy clock correction: 623rd 1/60 sec
	                        does not increment time

Let's go into details.

### F77A-F799 24h timer

The code between F77A and F799 does the TI count as it is already known
from the discussion from the C64.

1. $F77A: The Jiffy counter at $8F-$8D (interestingly in high byte first) is increased
2. $F784: The Jiffy counter is compared to the data at $F7AC. This is 5184001 - equivalent to 24h in 1/60s Jiffies, plus 1.
3. $F792: If the Jiffy counter has reached 24h, it is reset to zero

That is actually easy, it only has a off-by-one error as has been shown for the C64 already in the 8bit show and tell vide.

### F768-F779, F79B 623rd Jiffy correction

In $99/$9A there is a counter that is increased on every interrupt call.
Once this counter reaches the value 623, the following Jiffy increase is skipped, and the correction counter reset to zero (at $F79B).

So that means that every 623 calls, a Jiffy increase is skipped. That is a change in frequency by 0.16%.
Why is that?

This actually is a leftover from the early PET models that did not have a CRTC video controller. In those models the video signal was generated by a bunch of logic chips. The timing of this circuit was that 
a full screen had 16640 cycles. This would result in a Jiffy clock of slightly above 60Hz, i.e. 60.096 Hz, or +0.16% off. Correcting this by skipping over every 623rd Jiffy pulse results in 59.999969 Hz (if it was
ever that accurate), or -0.0005% off. 

This is the only reason I can think of why this correction would have been necessary. One may still wonder why Commodore went so far out of their way to get such a correction - when a typical 16Mhz clock
oscillator that was used on a PET as clock source already "only" has an accuracy of +/- 100 PPM, or +/-0.01%. 


## Summary

1. PET has models with 50Hz and 60Hz screen refresh. The Editor ROM defines the screen refresh, and correcty the Jiffy counter appropriately, so that in average 60 Jiffies per seconds are counted. For 50 Hz models, every 5 Jiffies, a 6th one is added.
2. In 50Hz mode the vertical interrupt frequency is exactly 50Hz. In 60Hz mode the frequency is about 1/1000 off, at 60.06Hz. 
2. There is a 622/623 correction in the kernel (that is the same for all 50 and 60Hz models) that is an (incorrect) leftover from the PET models without CRTC, and could/should potentially be removed.
